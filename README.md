# Genmod1.0—the General Groundwater-Model (General Models) Construction System Version 1.0, revised June 2018

Genmod1.0 (user guide report available at: https://doi.org/10.5066/F72V2FDC and jupyter notebooks [JN] and supporting files available at https://github.com/usgs/gw-general-models.git) documents subsequent revisions and improvements to the JN of Genmod0.1 (see section below).

A user is encouraged to read the user guide report available at: +++Put citation doi here+++ before attempting to run the JN of Genmod1.0. Also see instruction file “Genmod1p0_userguide_GITHUB_README_Nov2018.pdf” found in folder "gw-general-models/Genmod1.0/".

Refer to folder "gw-general-models/Genmod1.0/" for updated files for Genmod1.0.

The rest of the files and folders found at "gw-general-models” are associated with Genmod0.1.


 Alternatively, two additional zip files are available for download on the ScienceBase catalog of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at “https://doi.org/10.5066/F72V2FDC”. These separate zip files are made available as a convenience so the user does not have to 1. create the conda environment and 2. download the separate components and JN of Genmod1.0 from the GitHub repository, create the necessary folder structure, or download any input datasets from their respective sources in order to run the JN of Genmod1.0 for the example model “Assabet”.

# Genmod0.1 (General Groundwater-Model Construction System Version 0.1)
