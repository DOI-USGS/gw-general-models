# Genmod0.1 (General Groundwater-Model Construction System Version 0.1)

The Genmod0.1 repository contains files that support the General Groundwater-Model Construction System Version 0.1. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5066/F7FQ9VTD

Each of the zip files are separate components of the directory-tree structure for Genmod.

Procedure:

Download and unzip each zip file: conda_environment.7z, executables.zip, and subprojects.zip and place the resulting folder into a top-level directory called 'C:\General_Models_WRR'. Download Genmod+README.pdf and place it in the \readme folder. See the directory-tree structure for Genmod below:

C:\General_Models_WRR\conda_environment

C:\General_Models_WRR\executables

C:\General_Models_WRR\general-models

C:\General_Models_WRR\input_data

C:\General_Models_WRR\readme

C:\General_Models_WRR\subprojects

Four compressed files (Models_1.7z, Models_2.7z, Models_3.7z, and Models_4.7z) contain calibrated models made with Genmod. Place the contents of each file in the C:\General_Models_WRR\subprojects\siteGeneral folder.

The directory structure must be maintained to enable the system to function properly. One zip file for input_data (uncompressed size is 41 GB) is found at the ftp site:

ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/ma/northborough/JS_WRR/General_Models_WRR

download the input_data zip file and place it in the above tree.

To run the notebooks, follow instructions found in the file in Genmod+README.pdf.
