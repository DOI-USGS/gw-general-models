Genmod (General Groundwater-Model Construction System Version 0.1)

The Genmod repository contains files that support the General Groundwater-Model Construction System Version 0.1. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5066/F7FQ9VTD

Each of the zip files are separate components of the directory-tree structure for Genmod.
Procedure:

Download and unzip each zip file: conda_environment.7z, executables.zip, and subprojects.zip and place the resulting folder into a top-level directory called 'C:\General_Models_WRR'. See the directory-tree structure for Genmod below:
"C:\General_Models_WRR\conda_environment"
"                     \executables"
"                     \general-models"
"                     \input_data"
"                     \readme"
"                     \subprojects"
                     
The directory structure must be maintained to enable the system to function properly.

The readme folder contains Genmod+README.docx

One zip file for input_data is found at the ftp site:

ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/ma/northborough/JS_WRR/General_Models_WRR

download the input_data zip file and place it in the above tree.
