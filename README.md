Generalized groundwater models

Six zip files plus this readme.txt file are found at the ftp site:

ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/ma/northborough/JS_WRR/General_Models_WRR

Each of the zip files are separate components of the directory-tree structure for the
General Groundwater-Model Construction System (Version 0.1)

Procedure:

Download and unzip each zip file and place the resulting folder into a top-level directory 
called 'C:\General_Models_WRR' 

The directory structure must be maintained to enable the system to function properly.

When done, the top-level path 'C:\General_Models_WRR' will contain the folder contained in
each zip file as follows plus this readme.txt:


C:\General_Models_WRR\conda_environment
                     \executables
                     \general-models
                     \input_data
                     \readme
                     \subprojects
                     \readme.txt
                     
To run the notebooks, follow instructions found in the file in readme.zip.
